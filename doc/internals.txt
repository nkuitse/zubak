Lines beginning with `$' specify backup properties.  The following properties
must be present:

    $backup     the backup identifier (see below)
    $begin      the time (seconds since the Unix epoch) at which the backup began
    $end        the time (seconds since the Unix epoch) at which the backup ended
    $size       the size (in bytes) of the backup data

The backup identifier has the form <site>:<target>:<series>:<timestamp>.

<site> is configured in $ZUBAK_ROOT/zubak.conf.

<target> is the path to the target relative to $ZUBAK_ROOT/targets.

The series number begins with 1.

The timestamp is ...

Lines beginning with `-' indicate files that have been deleted (or moved) since
the previous backup.

The metadata line for a file may, in the case of regular files and symlinks, be
followed by a line beginning with `@' and the offset, within the backup data,
of the contents of a file or symlink.  The file length (st_size) is also
repeated in this line.  For regular files, a BLAKE2b hash of the file's
contents may also be present; it is in hexadecimal form prefixed by `#'.  These
lines should not be present unless the backup data is generated by eubar(1), as
they are not otherwise meaningful.
