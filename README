zubak performs backups (full or incremental) using a set of zsh scripts.

Targets are stored within the `targets' directory in zubak's root directory
(/var/local/backup or another directory as defined by $ZUBAK_ROOT).  Target
configuration consists of a set of files within the directory `conf' in the
target directory.  (Currently, zubak will not descend more than two levels when
looking for target directories within the `targets' directory.)

Backups are grouped in one or more series, numbered from 1 up and stored in the
target's `series' directory.  A series consists of a full backup and zero or
more incremental or differential backups.  (At this point differential backups
have not been implemented.)  To perform a full backup, you must create a new
series:

    zubak ns TARGET

A backup within a series does not have any dependency on a backup in any other
series; a series is a self-contained, independent entity.

When culling of backup data is desired, it is expected that whole series, not
individual backups, will be deleted.  It may be possible to safely delete
individual backups, but zubak does not have the capability to do that itself.

Custom backups may be defined using
